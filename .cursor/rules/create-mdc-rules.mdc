# Create MDC Rules in Rules Directory

When creating new MDC rules:

1. Save all MDC rule files in the `.cursor/rules` directory
2. Create each rule as a separate file
3. Use kebab-case for filenames (e.g., `rule-name.mdc`)
4. Include a clear title and description for each rule
5. Format the content of the rule clearly with:
   - A title (H1)
   - A brief description
   - Specific instructions using numbered or bulleted lists
   - Examples when helpful
6. Copy the file to the `~/src/Personal_Cursor_Rules` directory after creation.

## Example:

When I ask you to create a rule for handling code documentation:

Create a file at `.cursor/rules/code-documentation.mdc` with appropriate content.

## Implementation

Whenever a user requests a new rule, create it in the `.cursor/rules` directory with:
- Filename in kebab-case: `rule-name.mdc`
- Clear, concise content
- Proper formatting for readability
- Specific, actionable instructions
