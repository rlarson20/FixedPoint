# Implementation Order & Development Approach

This rule outlines the recommended sequence and approach for implementing the FixedPoint project.

## Implementation Sequence

1. Follow this ordered development approach:
   - Server API with dummy matching logic
   - Basic extension UI
   - Vault parsing implementation
   - Matching algorithm iteration
   - Error handling and edge cases
   - Testing infrastructure
   - Documentation writing

2. Start with the first milestone goals:
   - Manual vault path input in extension
   - Basic filename-based matching
   - Note creation in root folder fallback
   - Local server with hardcoded test vault

3. Implement subsequent features incrementally:
   - Advanced matching algorithms
   - UI refinements
   - Error handling enhancements
   - Performance optimizations

## Development Methodology

1. Apply iterative development:
   - Build minimum viable components first
   - Test each component thoroughly before integration
   - Gather feedback and refine continuously

2. Maintain testability throughout:
   - Write tests alongside implementation
   - Use mock objects for dependencies
   - Ensure high code coverage for critical paths

3. Focus on robust error handling:
   - Implement error handling from the start
   - Use defensive programming principles
   - Test with invalid inputs and edge cases

## Component Integration

1. Establish clean interfaces between components:
   - Well-defined API contracts
   - Clear data formats and schemas
   - Proper error propagation

2. Develop integration tests:
   - Test Firefox extension with server
   - Test server with actual Obsidian vaults
   - Verify end-to-end workflows

3. Document integration requirements:
   - Network configuration
   - Permission requirements
   - Configuration options

## Distribution & Documentation

1. Prepare deployment packages:
   - Firefox Add-ons store package
   - PyInstaller executable
   - Setup scripts

2. Create comprehensive documentation:
   - Installation guides
   - Configuration options
   - Troubleshooting steps

3. Provide setup verification tools:
   - System compatibility check
   - Self-test functionality
   - Sample configuration
