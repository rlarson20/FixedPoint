# FixedPoint Extension Testing Strategy

## Current Testing Status

### Existing Setup
- Basic test infrastructure is configured in `package.json` with `"test": "bun test"`
- Jest types are installed (`@types/jest`)
- No dedicated test files or directories are currently present
- No test coverage reporting is configured
- No end-to-end testing framework is set up

### Code Structure
The extension consists of several key components that need testing:
- Background Scripts (`src/background/`)
- Popup UI (`src/popup/`)
- Utility Functions (`src/utils/`)
- Type Definitions (`src/types/`)

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Unit Testing Setup
- Implement Jest with Bun for unit testing
- Create a `__tests__` directory in each component folder
- Add test coverage reporting using `bun test --coverage`
- Configure Jest for TypeScript support

### 2. Component Testing
- Add React Testing Library for popup UI components
- Set up component snapshot testing
- Implement user interaction testing for popup components

### 3. Integration Testing
- Create integration tests for background script functionality
- Test browser extension API interactions
- Implement message passing tests between components

### 4. End-to-End Testing
- Set up Playwright for browser extension testing
- Create E2E test scenarios for:
  - Extension installation
  - Popup interactions
  - Background script operations
  - Browser API interactions

### 5. Test Coverage Goals
- Aim for 80% code coverage minimum
- 100% coverage for critical paths
- Focus on testing browser extension specific functionality

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Unit Testing
1. Configure Jest with Bun
2. Set up test coverage reporting
3. Create initial test structure
4. Implement basic utility function tests

### Phase 2: Component Testing
1. Add React Testing Library
2. Create popup component tests
3. Implement snapshot testing
4. Add user interaction tests

### Phase 3: Integration Testing
1. Set up background script testing
2. Implement browser API mocking
3. Create message passing tests
4. Add storage operation tests

### Phase 4: End-to-End Testing
1. Configure Playwright
2. Create basic E2E test scenarios
3. Implement browser extension specific tests

## Testing Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Place test files in `__tests__` directories
- Use `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` suffix for test files
- Keep test files close to implementation
- Use descriptive test names

### Test Structure
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Group related tests using describe blocks
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

### Best Practices
- Write tests before fixing bugs
- Maintain test independence
- Use appropriate assertions
- Keep tests focused and atomic
- Document complex test scenarios

## Next Steps

1. Create initial test configuration
2. Set up Jest with Bun
3. Implement first test suite for utility functions
4. Add test coverage reporting

## Success Metrics
- Test coverage > 80%
- All critical paths tested
- No regressions in existing functionality
- All browser extension APIs properly tested
